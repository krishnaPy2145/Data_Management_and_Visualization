1) Is certain occurrence of incidents is any association with Airports bases on Claim_Type ?

Project is to prepare and analyze Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Airport Claims data from 2002 through 2017. 
The TSA is an agency of the United States Department of Homeland Security that has authority over the security of the traveling public. 
A claim is filed if you/we are injured or your/our property is lost or damaged during the screening process at an airport


2) Collection of the raw data

The data that is TSAClaims_2002_2017.csv, which was created from the following:
• TSA Airport Claims data from https://www.dhs.gov/tsa-claims-data.
• FAA Airport Facilities data from https://www.faa.gov/airports/airport_safety/airportdata_5010/.
  The TSAClaims_2002_2017.csv file was created by concatenating each individual TSA Airport Claims table. 
  After the concatenation, the data was joined with the FAA Airport Facilities data. Here are a few notes regarding the data:
• All data is public data, and accuracy is not guaranteed.
• The column Airport_Codes from the TSA Airport Claims data has been joined with Location_ID from the FAA Airports Facilities data. 
  Some Airport_Codes values do not correspond to Location_ID values.
• Columns in the TSA Airport Claims data have changed over the years. 
  Because of this, some of the original columns were removed from the data for this case study.
• The column Item_Category does not have consistent input values over the years. 
 

3) Cleaning of the data

Import the raw data file TSAClaims_2002_2017.csv.
• Dataframe should be named claims_cleaned.
• Entirely duplicated records need to be removed from the data set.
• All missing and “-“ values in the columns Claim_Type, Claim_Site, and Disposition must be changed to Unknown.
• Values in the columns Claim_Type, Claim_Site, and Disposition must follow the requirements in the data layout.
• All StateName values should be in proper case.
• All State values should be in uppercase.
• Creating a new column named Date_Issues with a value of Needs Review to indicate that a row has a date issue. 
   Date issues consist of the following:
      –a missing value for Incident_Date or Date_Received
	  – an Incident_Date or Date_Received value out of the predefined year range of 2002 through 2017
	  – an Incident_Date value that occurs after the Date_Received value
• Remove the County and City columns.
• Currency should be permanently formatted with a dollar sign and include two decimal points.
• All dates should be permanently formatted in the style 01JAN2000.
• Permanent labels should be assigned columns by replacing the underscores with a space.
• Final data should be sorted in ascending order by Incident_Date.


4) Data Layout

A) Claim_Number
Number for each claim. Some claims can have duplicate claim numbers but different information for each claim. 
Those claims are considered valid for this case study. Any duplicate rows should be removed from the data.

B) Date_Received 
Date the claim was received. Date_Received must occur after Incident_Date. 
Range: From 2002 through 2017 

C) Incident_Date 
Date the incident occurred. Incident_Date must occur before Date_Received. 
Range: From 2002 through 2017

E) Airport_Code 
Airport code three-letter abbreviation.

F) Airport_Name 
Full name of the airport.

G)Claim_Type 
Category of the claim. 
If the claim is separated into two types by a slash, 
Claim_Type is the first type. 
For example: Personal Property Loss/Injury is considered Personal Property Loss. 
Possible values (14): 
	• Bus Terminal 
	• Complaint 
	• Compliment 
	• Employee Loss (MPCECA)

	• Not Provided 
	• Passenger Property Loss 
	• Passenger Theft 
	• Personal Injury 
	• Property Damage 
	• Property Loss

Possible values (8): 
	• Bus Station 
	• Checked Baggage 
	• Checkpoint 
	• Motor Vehicle 
	• Not Provided 
	• Other 
	• Pre-Check 
	• Unknown
	
I)Item_Category 
Type of items that have been filed in the claim. 
Depending on the year of the data, the Item_Category values are input differently. 
Because of varying consistency, you do not clean this column for the case study.

J) Close_Amount 
The dollar amount a claim was closed for.

K) Disposition 
The final settlement of the claim. 
Possible values (10): 
	• *Insufficient 
	• Approve in Full 
	• Closed:Canceled

N) City 
Associated airport city name (for example, CHICAGO).

5) Additional 
	A. How many date issues are in the overall data?
	B. How many claims per year of Incident_Date are in the overall data? Be sure to include a plot.
	C. Lastly, a user should be able to dynamically input a specific state value and answer the following:
    D. What are the frequency values for Claim_Type for the selected state?
	E.What are the frequency values for Claim_Site for the selected state?
	F. What are the frequency values for Disposition for the selected state?
	G. What is the mean, minimum, maximum, and sum of Close_Amount for the selected state? Round to the nearest integer.
